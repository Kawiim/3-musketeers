## Introduction

Coding is not only to write code.

## Objective - Workshop in 1 sentence

The library [cash](./cash) that we need to

* write the README.md
* write missing comments with JSDoc

The library [bitcoin](./bitcoin) that we need to

* write Unit Tests (with Jest as testing framework)


## Just tell me what to do

* Fork the project via `github`
* Clone your forked repository project `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3-musketeers`

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace
❯ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/3-musketeers.git
```

### RDD and CDD

* complete the [cash/README.md](./cash/README.md) file with a complete description of installation, usage... of the library
* add JSDOC function blocks for the 3 files [cash/bin/cash.js](./cash/bin/cash.js), [cash/bin/helpers.js](./cash/bin/helpers.js) and [cash/bin/index.js](./cash/bin/index.js)

### TDD

Execute unit test with `npm run test` or `yarn run test`

* write the unit tests [bitcoin/__tests__/convert.js](bitcoin/__tests__/convert.js) to cover 80%

* commit your different modifications:

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/3-musketeers
❯ git add -A && git commit -m "docs(readme): describe how to use cash"
```

([why following a commit message convention?](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits))

1. Don't forget to push before the end of the workshop

```sh
❯ git push origin master
```
